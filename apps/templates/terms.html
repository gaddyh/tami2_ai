    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="text-sm text-slate-400 mb-8">Last updated: August 18, 2025</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Agreement to Terms</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">These Terms govern your access to and use of Tami (the "Service") provided by Tami Ltd ("Tami", "we", "us"). By using the Service, you agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Description of Service</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Tami provides tools for scheduled messaging, AI drafting/summarization, and search over user-provided content. Tami is not affiliated with WhatsApp or Meta.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Accounts & Eligibility</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-1">
      <li>You must provide accurate information and keep it updated.</li>
      <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Your Content & License</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">You retain ownership of your content. You grant Tami a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, process, and display it solely to provide and improve the Service.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Acceptable Use</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-1">
      <li>No unlawful, harmful, infringing, or spam activity.</li>
      <li>Obtain required consents for messaging recipients and comply with privacy laws.</li>
      <li>No reverse engineering, bypassing security, or abusing rate limits.</li>
      <li>No use in life-critical or high-risk scenarios.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Third-Party Dependencies & Delivery</h2>
    <div class="bg-slate-800 border border-slate-700 rounded p-4 mb-4 text-sm">
      The Service depends on third-party networks and providers (including WhatsApp, device availability, AI vendors). We do not guarantee uninterrupted service or delivery times. Scheduled messages may be delayed, duplicated, or not delivered.
      Scheduled messages include a brief automatic retry window; if delivery still fails, Tami will notify you and require manual resend.
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Scheduled Messaging & Retries</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      At the scheduled time Tami attempts immediate delivery. If delivery fails due to a transient condition
      (e.g., device offline, network hiccup, temporary provider error), Tami performs a fast automatic retry
      within a short retry window. If delivery still fails, the message is marked <span class="font-semibold">Action Required</span>
      and you are notified so you can manually send or reschedule.
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4 space-y-1">
      <li><span class="font-semibold">Fast retry:</span> a limited burst of automatic retries shortly after the scheduled time.</li>
      <li><span class="font-semibold">Failure notification:</span> in-app alert (and email/WhatsApp if configured) with the failed item highlighted.</li>
      <li><span class="font-semibold">Manual control:</span> Tami does not continue attempting indefinitely; you can resend, edit, or delete.</li>
      <li><span class="font-semibold">Limits:</span> Delivery may still fail due to platform restrictions, device state, or provider outages. See the sections “Third-Party Dependencies & Delivery” and “Limitation of Liability”.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="bg-slate-800 border border-slate-700 rounded p-4 mb-4 text-sm">
      Scheduled messaging is not intended for life-critical or high-risk scenarios. For time-sensitive events, keep a manual fallback.
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Service Levels</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">The Service is provided on a best-effort basis and “as is”. Unless a separate signed SLA applies, no uptime or delivery guarantees are offered.</p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Fees, Billing, Refunds</h2>

      refunds may be issued at our discretion.
    </p>

      <li>Upon termination, we will delete or de-identify your content per our <a href="/privacy" class="text-indigo-400 hover:underline">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Indemnification</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Tami and its affiliates from and against any claims,
      liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including legal fees) arising from your use of the
